New Components and Configuration:

Additional Server:
Purpose: To distribute the workload more effectively and increase redundancy.
Role: This server can be used as either a web server, application server, or database server, depending on the requirements.

HAProxy Load Balancer Cluster:
Purpose: To ensure high availability and distribute traffic evenly across multiple servers.
Role: The load balancer cluster will ensure that if one load balancer fails, the other can take over without disrupting service.
Configuration: The load balancers will be configured in an active-active setup to balance the load and provide redundancy.

Splitting Components:

Web Server (Nginx):
Purpose: To handle HTTP requests and serve static content.
Role: Each web server will handle incoming requests, serve static files, and forward dynamic requests to the application server.

Application Server:
Purpose: To execute business logic and handle dynamic content.
Role: Each application server will process requests, execute code, and interact with the database.

Database Server (MySQL):
Purpose: To store and manage data.
Role: Each database server will handle database operations. In a master-slave setup, one server will handle writes (master), and the others will handle reads (slaves).

Detailed Explanation of Each Element:

Additional Server:
Purpose: Adding another server helps distribute the load, ensuring that no single server is overwhelmed. This increases the overall capacity and reliability of the system.

Load Balancer Cluster:
Purpose: The HAProxy load balancer cluster ensures high availability and reliability. By having multiple load balancers, the system can continue to operate even if one load balancer fails.
Active-Active Setup: Both load balancers actively distribute traffic, providing better load distribution and redundancy. In case one fails, the other can handle the traffic without any disruption.

Splitting Components:

Web Server (Nginx):
Purpose: To handle static content and forward dynamic requests to the application server.
Role: Each web server manages client connections and distributes requests to the appropriate application servers.

Application Server:
Purpose: To handle the business logic and dynamic content generation.
Role: Each application server processes requests, interacts with the database, and generates responses.

Database Server (MySQL):
Purpose: To manage data storage and retrieval.
Role: The database servers handle read and write operations. A master-slave setup can be used where the master handles writes and slaves handle reads, providing better performance and reliability.

Issues and Considerations:

SPOF (Single Point of Failure):
Mitigation: The load balancer cluster and multiple servers for each component help eliminate single points of failure.

Security:
Considerations: Ensure firewalls are in place for each server, and SSL termination is handled properly to maintain secure communication.

Monitoring:
Purpose: To provide insights into the performance and health of each server.
Tools: Monitoring clients should be installed on each server to collect data on CPU usage, memory usage, disk I/O, network traffic, and other critical metrics.
Data Collection: Monitoring tools will collect and aggregate data to provide real-time alerts and insights.
